# PAPER_Dormancy_resuscitation_phytohormone_mesocosm_Bandopadhyay2024
####This repository contains the R code used to analyze and visualize the active bacterial community dynamics from a lab incubation study designed to understand the dormancy resuscitation dynamics of root asssociated soil bacteria in response to stress signals. We added stress asscociated plant hormones ABA and SA to mesocosms containing root zone soil from common bean and switchgrass crops and tracked the active bacterial community dyanamics from a dormant to an active state over 24 h, 7 days and 14 days.
